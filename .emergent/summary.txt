The AI engineer successfully guided the user through an iterative development process, starting with establishing a clear communication language (Spanish). The initial task was to understand the codebase, which was identified as a React (frontend) + FastAPI (backend) + MongoDB (database) full-stack application.

The trajectory shows a clear progression from clarifying basic platform functionalities (testing, deployment, migration) to building a foundational authentication and role management system (JWT + Google OAuth). The user then pivoted to a specific application idea: a multi-lavadero (laundry service) management system with , , and  roles, detailed with booking, payment, and administrative features.

The AI adopted an incremental approach, confirming plans at each major phase. Key decisions included using JWT for authentication, integrating Emergent Auth for Google OAuth, and establishing a robust role-based access control. Several bugs were encountered and resolved, notably related to Google OAuth redirection, session persistence, timezone comparison in datetimes, CORS issues, and navigation protection. The AI consistently provided summaries and sought user approval before proceeding, demonstrating adherence to the system prompt's guidelines for detailed analysis, incremental development, and user feedback. The last major set of features involved refining admin management, implementing unique lavadero name validation, and distinguishing login/logout flows for admins/clients.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested an understanding of the AI's capabilities and operational aspects, including Spanish communication, testing procedures, deployment, and migration options. Upon satisfaction, the user tasked the AI with building a flexible authentication and role-management system (Admin/Employee) as a base. This evolved into a Dashboard de Gestión - Demo de Roles for proof-of-concept.

The core product requirement then became a comprehensive Sistema de Gestión de Lavaderos (Laundry Service Management System). This application is envisioned as a multi-tenant platform where:
-   **Roles:**  (owner of the application),  (owner of a specific laundry service), and  (customer booking appointments).
-   **Super Admin (kearcangel@gmail.com):** Manages all laundry services, approves new admins/laundry services (after payment proof), blocks/unblocks services based on monthly payments, and can see all data across all laundries. Can create/modify/delete other admins.
-   **Admin:** Owns and configures a specific laundry service (operating hours, service duration, bank alias for client payments, non-working days). Manages appointments for their laundry service, views client payment proofs, and confirms bookings. Pays a monthly fee to the Super Admin. Cannot view data from other laundry services.
-   **Client:** Selects a laundry service, registers/logs in to that specific service, views available/occupied slots via a calendar, books appointments, makes bank transfers for payments, and uploads payment proof (screenshot). Can cancel appointments.
-   **Functionality:** Real-time laundry status (open/closed), appointment booking/cancellation, payment processing via bank transfer proof (image upload), multi-laundry support, role-based dashboards, and a tiered login system.
-   **Non-functional:** Functionality-first approach, minimal aesthetics initially.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management, Google OAuth via Emergent Auth for third-party login.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Differentiated dashboards and protected routes based on , ,  roles.
-   **Data Models:** MongoDB schema design for users, laundries, configurations, appointments, and payment proofs.
-   **API Development:** RESTful API endpoints with  prefix, request validation, and error handling.
-   **CORS:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration for frontend-backend communication.
-   **Environment Variables:** Secure management of sensitive information like database URLs and backend URLs.
-   **Session Management:** Cookie-based sessions for authentication persistence.
</key_technical_concepts>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing and refining the administrative functionalities for the  and  roles, specifically addressing feedback from the user in Chat Message 468.

The work encompassed:
1.  **Unique Lavadero Name Validation:** Backend validation added to ensure lavadero names are unique, ignoring case. (Chat Message 470)
2.  **Super Admin Admin Management:**
    *   Added backend endpoints () to create new administrators, activate lavaderos directly (as if payment was made for testing), update admin details, and delete admins. (Chat Messages 472, 490)
    *   The  frontend component was updated to provide this functionality, including inline editing, delete confirmation, and displaying passwords (plaintext for testing purposes). (Chat Messages 498-504)
3.  **Role-Specific Logout Redirection:** The  function in the frontend was modified to redirect  and  users to  upon logout, while  users are redirected to . (Chat Messages 473-474)
4.  **Client-Specific Login Page Protection:**
    *   A  component was introduced in the frontend to ensure that the  route (intended for clients after selecting a lavadero) is only accessible in specific contexts. It prevents direct navigation or access by authenticated users. (Chat Messages 475-484)
5.  **Admin Credentials Display in AdminLogin:** For testing convenience, the  page was updated to display a list of existing  credentials (email and plaintext password) along with the  credentials. This required a new backend endpoint  to retrieve plaintext passwords for testing. (Chat Messages 489-496)

The AI confirmed that these features are implemented and functioning as expected through internal tests (Chat Messages 507-509). The  now shows correct statistics,  lists all admins with their statuses, and the login/logout flows are correctly differentiated.

<optional_next_step>
Await user feedback/decision on the recently implemented features regarding admin management, login/logout flows, and lavadero name validation.
